## JavaFX subtitle adjuster

This GUI app can modify SRT subtitle files. You can delay or speed 
up subtitles with any amount of *seconds/milliseconds*

Here is how the GUI looks:

# How to use 

Download the *JAR* from the releases, go to the folder with the console and run it with: 

```
java -jar SRTAdjuster.jar
```

Double clicking to start it **should** also work but I can't get it to work with *JavaFX* apps.
